# Laboperator Workflow Schema

> In JSON's structured form,\
A schema for labs is born,\
Defining workflows to transform\
Experiments into automated norms.
>
>With keys and values aligned\
Each step of the process defined,\
From sample prep to data combined,\
Efficiency and precision entwined.
>
>No more manual toil and strife,\
As machines perform tasks with life,\
And scientists focus on the rife,\
Groundbreaking discoveries ahead in sight.
>
>So let this schema be the guide,\
To automate and simplify with pride,\
As lab experiments reach new heights,\
And knowledge flows like a rising tide.

## About

Laboperator workflows are described by template files referred to as _Workflow Template_ and its subset, _Workflow Step Template_. Their structure is defined by JSON schemas. You can explore the schemas in the [documentation](https://schema.laboperator.com/workflow_schema_index/).

## Language Server Validation

To improve the experience of writing workflow templates, you can enable validation against the workflow schemas in your text editor by associating files with a JSON schema. See the [WIKI page](https://github.com/laboperator-gmbh/workflow-schema/wiki) for instructions.
