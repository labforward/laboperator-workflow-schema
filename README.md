# Laboperator Workflow Schema

Laboperator workflows are described by template files referred to as _Workflow Template_ and its subset, _Workflow Step Template_. Their structure is defined by JSON schemas. You can explore the schemas in the [documentation](https://schema.laboperator.com/workflow_schema_index/).

## Language Server Validation

To improve the experience of writing workflow templates, you can enable validation against the workflow schemas in your text editor by associating files with a JSON schema. See the [WIKI page](https://github.com/labforward/laboperator-workflow-schema/wiki) for instructions.
