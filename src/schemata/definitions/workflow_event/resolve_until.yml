title: ResolveUntil Event
description: |
  The event of resolving the condition in a `loop-until` flow of steps.

  If the condition in `until` resolves to a falsy value, the steps included in `loop` will be unfolded.
  Otherwise, the execution will break out of the `loop-until` flow and continue to evaluate the next entry in the parent flow.
