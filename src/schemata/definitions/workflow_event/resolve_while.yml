title: ResolveWhile Event
description: |
  The event of resolving the condition in a `while` flow of steps.

  If the condition in `while` resolves to a truthy value, the steps included in `do` will be unfolded.
  Otherwise, the execution will break out of the `while` flow and continue to evaluate the next entry in the parent flow.
