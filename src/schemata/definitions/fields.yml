title: Fields
description: |
  Fields are top-level and step-level variables in a workflow template. A field can be used to store and retrieve information during workflow execution.

  A field can be assigned a schema to validate its value.

  A field identifier, which is its key within the `fields` object, is considered unique in the context of a workflow. By definition a second occurrence of the same key will override the first occurrence. In markdown, fields can be referenced via their unique identifier:

  `{{myStringField}}`
propertyNames:
  $ref: '#/definitions/memberName'
additionalProperties:
  $ref: '#/definitions/field'
