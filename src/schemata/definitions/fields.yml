title: Fields
description: |
  Fields are top-level and step-level variables in a workflow template. A field can be used to store and retrieve information during workflow execution.

  Fields of type array and object can be assigned a schema to validate its value.

  A field identifier, which is its key within the `fields` object, is considered unique in the context of a workflow. By definition a second occurrence of the same key will override the first occurrence. In markdown, fields can be referenced via their unique identifier: `{{myStringField}}`
