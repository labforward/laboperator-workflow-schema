type: object
description: |
  Defines a field of type `timer`. Timers are used to measure time or execute time-controlled actions within a Workflow Run.

  Timers have two possible modes of operation: countdown and stopwatch.
  
  In **countdown** mode, the timer will run for a specified duration, and fire a `on_timer_complete` Trigger upon completion.
  In **stopwatch** mode, the timer measures time until it is stopped, either manually or through a Behavior.
  
  Timer fields can be assigned to individual substeps by passing the field identifier to the `timer` property.

  defaultDuration:
    description: |
      The default value set on the timer upon starting the workflow. If this is defined, the timer will run in countdown mode, unless the value is reset during workflow execution.

      The initial value of the timer can also be set using the `defaultValue` property. If both are defined, `defaultValue` will overwrite the value set in `defaultDuration`.
