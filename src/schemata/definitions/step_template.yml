title: The Workflow Step Template Schema
description: |
  A step is a closed set of activities and instructions. Steps can be defined
  independent of a workflow and then be reused across different workflows.

  A step descriptor file describes a workflow consisting of four parts:
  1. info: General information about the workflow.
  2. fields: Global context in this workflow.
  3. steps: Definition of all unique steps that occur in the workflow.
  4. workflow: The flow of steps and mapping of fields.
