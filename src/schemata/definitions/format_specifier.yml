  Number formatting is based on the excellent
  [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) library. Head over to their
  [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format) for a full reference
  and examples.

  The formatting specifiers are based on Python 3's
  [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language).

  A typical fixed point precision of two digits behind the decimal could be
  achieved with `.2f`.
examples:
  - 2f
