        Index of the substep from which on the step should be repeated. Substeps
        are always indexed form 0. So to passing `substep: 0`, would repeat the
        entire step.

        If no option is passed the index is taken from the trigger, e.g. a
        SubstepComplete trigger will repeat the just completed substep.
