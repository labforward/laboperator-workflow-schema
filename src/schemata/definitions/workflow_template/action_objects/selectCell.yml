        Set the selected cell based on calculated value from signal and fields.

        For example, if the signal come with the following structure:

          {
            'identifier' => 'myTable',
            'data' => { 'pointer' => '/1/density' }
          }

        You can set the selected cell to the row on index 1 of column 'density' by
        setting this property to 'data.pointer'.

        For the selection to work, the calculated value must resolve to a json pointer
        in the format of /[row-0-based-index]/[column-key]

        To unset the selection, the calculated value must resolve to 'null'.
