title: The Workflow Step Template Schema
description: |
  A step is a closed set of activities and instructions. Steps can be defined
  independent of a workflow and then be reused across different workflows.

  A step descriptor file describes a workflow consisting of four parts:
  1. info: General information about the workflow.
  2. fields: Global context in this workflow.
  3. steps: Definition of all unique steps that occur in the workflow.
  4. workflow: The flow of steps and mapping of fields.

      In a step, fields are optional. If no fields are defined, the fields of
      the workflow will be passed down to the step as they are. However, if
      the step does define fields, the fields of the workflow have to be
      actively mapped to be available and avoid name collisions.
