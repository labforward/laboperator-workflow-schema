  Buttons allow users to trigger actions with a single tap.

  Buttons defined at the workflow or step level can be used anywhere in the workflow or step respectively. Use its unique `key` or `id` value to reference a button inside markdown:

  `{{button|member-name}}`

  When defined at the substep level of a template, buttons automatically appear at the very bottom of the substep in the order in which they are defined. To manually place a substep button in the above shown format its `placement` setting must be set to `manual`.
