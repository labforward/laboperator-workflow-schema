title: If-Then-Else  Flow
description: |
  A conditional flow of steps or nested flow control schemas. In the well
  known if-then-else fashion a conditional flow through the workflow can be
  implemented.
required: [if, then]
additionalProperties: false
properties:
  if:
    $ref: '#/definitions/script'
    description: |
      The condition has access to all fields of the workflow. Any string
      result or numerical result other then zero will be considered truthy and
      trigger execution of the `then` workflow. A falsy value will trigger
      execution of the `else` workflow.
  then:
    $ref: '#/definitions/flow/flowControl'
  else:
    $ref: '#/definitions/flow/flowControl'
examples:
  - if: field1 > 100
    then:
      - step1
      - step2
    else: step3

  - if: field1 != field2
    then: step3
