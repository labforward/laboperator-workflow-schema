title: Loop Flow
description: |
  A loop flow of steps or nested flow control schemas. The loop will be
  repeated until a condition is met. The loop will be executed at least once.
  Once the condition evaluates to a truthy value the loop is broken and the
  loop flow is considered completed.
required: [loop, until]
additionalProperties: false
properties:
  loop:
    $ref: '#/definitions/flow/flowControl'
  until:
    $ref: '#/definitions/script'
    description: |
      The condition has access to all fields of the workflow. Any string
      result or numerical result other then zero will be considered truthy and
      trigger completion of the loop flow. A falsy value will trigger
      another iteration of the `loop` workflow.
examples:
  - loop:
      - step1
      - step2
    until: field1 > 100

  - loop: step3
    until: field1 != field2
