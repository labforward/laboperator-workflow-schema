title: Loop Flow
description: |
  A loop flow of steps or nested flow control schemas. The loop will be repeated until a condition is met. The loop will be executed at least once. Once the condition evaluates to a truthy value the loop is broken and the loop flow is considered completed.
required: [loop, until]
additionalProperties: false

  loop:

  until:

    description: |
      The condition has access to all global fields of the workflow. Local step fields cannot be referenced in a condition. Any string result or numerical result other then zero will be considered truthy and trigger execution of the `then` workflow. A falsy value will trigger execution of the `else` workflow.
examples:
  - loop:
      - step1
      - step2
    until: field1 > 100

  - loop: step3
    until: field1 != field2
