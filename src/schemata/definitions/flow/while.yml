      The condition has access to all global fields of the workflow. Local step fields cannot be referenced in a condition. Any string result or numerical result other then zero will be considered truthy and trigger execution of the `then` workflow. A falsy value will trigger execution of the `else` workflow.

examples:
  - while: field1 > 100
    do:
      - step1
      - step2

  - while: field1 != field2
    do: step3
