title: For-Each Integer Flow
description: |
  An iteration flow of steps or nested flow control schemas.
  The loop will be iterated up to the given limit of an iterator integer.
required: [forEach, to, do]
additionalProperties: false
properties:
  forEach:
    $ref: '#/definitions/memberName'
    description: |
      An intermediate iterator field which holds the index of current iteration.
      The field must be defined in the template as type `integer`.
  step:
    description: |
      The number by which to increase or decrease the `forEach` iterator integer.
    default: 1
    oneOf:
      - type: integer
      - $ref: '#/definitions/memberName'
  to:
    description: |
      The limit value at which the flow execution will break out of the loop.
      The check will be done exclusively.

      For example, given the following definition:

      ```yml
      forEach: iterator
      to: 5
      do: something
      ```

      The iteration will happens 5 times, during which the `iterator` field will be
      assigned the value of 0,1,2,3, and 4 respectively.
    oneOf:
      - type: integer
      - $ref: '#/definitions/memberName'
  do:
    $ref: '#/definitions/flow/flowControl'
examples:
  - forEach: iterator
    to: 10
    do:
      - step1
      - step2
  - forEach: iterator
    step: 2
    to: 10
    do:
      - step1
      - step2
  - forEach: iterator
    step: iterator # non-linear steps
    to: boundary # also works with field references
    do:
      - step1
      - step2
