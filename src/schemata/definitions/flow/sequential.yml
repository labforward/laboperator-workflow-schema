title: Sequential Flow
description: |
  A sequence steps or nested flow control schemas. In a sequential flow consecutive items will always be executed one after another. Therefore, a nested flow has to be completed before a consecutive item can be started. The sequential flow is the only implicit flow, meaning it does not have any key words or properties. It is typically used as the top-level flow control in a workflow.
