      The responsive width of the element. The value is the number of columns that the element should occupy based on a 12-column grid layout.

      There are 5 breakpoints allowing to define multiple width values for different screen sizes.

      A single number may be provided and applied to all breakpoints if there is no reason to resize the element for different screen sizes.

      Can be used to render the element inside text (e.g. substep description)
      in the format {{element|memberName}}.
      For example, when id is defined as "rotationGauge" the text may look like:

      Use this view to monitor the stirring speed {{element|rotationGauge}}
    $ref: '#/definitions/member-name'
  placement:

      When set to `manual` the element won't be displayed in the substep. To render the element it has to be referenced inside the description markdown: `{{element|rotationGauge}}`. Replace `rotationGauge` with the
      value of the `id` property from your element definition.
