title: Table rules
description: |
  Rules can be leveraged to dynamically change both the behavior and appearance of a table.

  When a rule condition is fulfilled, the `editable` and `selectable` behavior of cells, rows, columns, or tabs can be set. Likewise, the background color or text color can be changed to visualize a certain state or change of behavior to the user. For example:

    - When a cell number value is negative, change the background color to red.
    - When a cell number value is positive, change the background color to green, make it selectable, but no longer editable.
    - When all cells in a column have no value, the column cells are not selectable or editable across all other tabs of the table.

    range:
      type: object
      description: |
        The range of columns, rows and tabs that the rules apply to. Use the [mathematical ellipsis notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis#In_mathematical_notation) to define a sequence of successive values from a start point to an end point inclusively. The range is zero-based, meaning its first entity is assigned the index 0.
        You can specify one or multiple properties to define a selection of cells. Setting only the `rows` value, for example, would apply a given set of rules to all cells in the defined rows in all tabs. Including the `columns` and `tabs` settings would then narrow down that selection.

Theme colors can be applied using the `error`, `warning`, `success` and `info` keywords. When choosing colors, also consider the default highlight styles of tables for cell and row selection to ensure sufficient contrast.
