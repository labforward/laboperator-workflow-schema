title: Behaviors Schema
description: |
  Behaviors provide means to define the behavior of a step. They can be used
  to control devices, record results, wait for device responses, control flow
  within a step and much more. The general scheme of a behavior is
  `trigger` => `action`.

  Behaviors are always treated as parallel independent definitions.
