title: Steps Section Schema
description: |
  The `steps` section defines all steps used in a workflow. A step is a set
  of closed activities and instructions. Steps can be defined outside of a
  workflow and then be reused across different workflows.

  The `steps` sections maps inline or external definitions to a key that
  is unique within this workflow. That key or identifier must be unique among
  the keys in the steps object. If a key is defined twice the later definition
  overrides the previous.

  Steps defined outside of this workflow template can use the fields defined
  for this workflow by mapping them to the internally defined fields in the
  workflow section of the workflow template.
