          {
            "registered_value": {{volumeField}}
          }
          The example above will generate a request with the following body:
          {
            "registered_value": "10ml"
          }

          {
            "stepPointer": {{workflow_step.pointer}}
          }
          The example above will generate a request with the following body:
          {
            "stepPointer": "/steps/externalStep"
          }
