title: Field
description: |
  A valid field schema is either a valid JSON schema as per [Draft 7](http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#) or one of our custom field types. Some additional properties are allowed at the top level.
allOf:
  - type: object
    required: [type]
    properties:
      ui:widget:
        type: string
        enum: ['checkbox', 'switch', 'text', 'textarea']
        description: |
          A flag indicating the widget variant for fields of type `string` or `boolean`. All other field types ignore this setting.
          Boolean fields can be displayed as either a checkbox or a switch to toggle between a binary state. The default appearance is a checkbox. Fields of type `string` can be configured as a multi-line textarea element. Their default appearance is a single-line text input.
      ui:options:
        type: object
        description: |
          Display configuration options for certain field types and widget settings. If a field or widget does not support `ui:options`, the setting is ignored.
        properties:
          label:
            type: boolean
            default: true
            description: |
              A flag indicating whether a field of type `boolean` has a display label. Setting this to `false` will display either only a checkbox or switch control element, without any visible label.
      readOnly:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          A flag indicating whether a field can be updated once the workflow run has been started.
      prepare:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          A flag indicating whether a field must be assigned a value before workflow execution can be started.

          Setting both the `prepare` and the `hidden` flag to `true` results in a validation error, because it would not be possible to start workflow execution.
      hidden:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          A flag indicating whether a field is hidden from the user. A hidden field can still be explicitly referenced as, for example, the source data for a table or in the description of a substep and thereby have a visual representation.

           Setting both the `prepare` and the `hidden` flag to `true` results in a validation error, because it would not be possible to start workflow execution.
      defaultValue:
        description: |
          Assign a default value to a field. Fields without a default value that also don't require a value to be assigned via the `prepare` flag are empty at the start of a workflow execution.
      output:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
          A flag indicating whether a field is included in the output of a workflow run export.
      formatSpecifier:
        $ref: '#/definitions/format-specifier'
        description: |
          A specifier describing number formatting for fields of type `number`, `integer`, and `quantity`. All other field types ignore this flag.
      group:
        type: string
        maxLength: 50
        description: |
          A flag that is used to group fields during the workflow preparation stage. Fields with the same group name are displayed together in the order of definition. All fields without a specified group are displayed separately.
      changeReason:
        $ref: '#/definitions/workflow-template/change-reason'
      customOptions:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          A flag indicating whether fields of type `string` or `number` that are configured with `enum` options can be updated with a value that is not among the specified options. If set to `true`, the user can both select from the specified options, as well as enter any custom value that satisfies the field schema. Fields that are not of type `string` or `number` ignore this setting.
