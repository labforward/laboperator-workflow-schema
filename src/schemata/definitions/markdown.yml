  ## Markdown

  Rich media content that can be formatted using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

  For a general introduction to Markdown go to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) or search for Markdown to find extensive resources online.

  ## Laboperator Flavoured Markdown

  Laboperator workflows extend Markdown with custom syntax to render
  additional content.

  ### Field References

  Reference fields defined in your workflow to dynamically display their
  current value.

  __Syntax__
  ```
  {{(field|)<identifier>|<variant>}}
  ```

  _Note that the `field` type indicator can be omitted for brevity._

  __Parameters__
  | __identifier__ | The identifier of the field that is referenced |
  | __variant__    | The reference variant. Should be one of `value`, `title`, `plain`. Defaults to `value`. |


  __Example 1__
  By default rendered values are highlighted against the background:
  ```
  Some text with an inline reference to {{myField}}.
  ```

  __Example 2__
  You can render the title of a field instead of the value using the `title`
  variant:
  ```
  The field _myField_ has the title {{myField|title}}.
  ```

  __Example 3__
  Using the `plain` variant you can render the plain value of a field without
  any highlights. This is for example useful for cleaner tables:
  ```
  | {{myField|title}} | {{anotherField|title}} |
  | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
  | {{myField|plain}} | {{anotherField|plain}} |
  ```

  ### Field Inputs

  Render inputs for fields defined in your workflow.

  __Syntax__
  ```
  {{field-input|<identifier>}}
  # or
  !{{<identifier>}}
  ```

  _Note that the `field-input` type indicator can be omitted for brevity, if the placeholder is prefixed with an exclamation mark (`!`)._

  __Parameters__
  | __identifier__ | The identifier of the field that is referenced |


  __Example 1__
  ```
  Please enter the observed color of the substance:
  !{{observedColor}}
  ```

  ### Grids

  You can use the `%col` tag to organize content in a grid.

  __Syntax__
  ```
  %col <container?> <card?> <breakpoint={1-12}?>
    # content is indented by two spaces or one tab
    content
  ```

  __Parameters__
  | __container__ | An optional flag that should be set if additional `%col` tags are nested inside. See __Example 2__. |
  | __card__ | An optional flag that can be set if the block should get a background. |
  | __breakpoint__ | Breakpoints can be used to specifically set how many columns of a 12 column grid the block should span. See [Material UI Fluid Grids](https://material-ui.com/components/grid/#fluid-grids) for details. Possible breakpoints are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. The value can be between `1` and `12`. |

  __Example 1: Simple columns
  ```
  %col
    This text is in one column.
  %col
    And this text in a second column next to it.


  %col
    This text is in a second row.
  %col card
    This text is in a second row in the second column and has a background
  %col
    This row can have a different number of columns. This is the third.
  ```

  __Example 2: Nested columns
  ```
  %col container card
    %col
      This is a the first column inside an outer block with background.
    %col container
      %col
        We can nest this even further
      %col
        Allowing us to build complex layouts
  ```

  __Example 2: Breakpoints
  ```
  %col xs={12} md={6}
    On a small screen this column fills up the whole width.

    On a tablet in landscape it will only fill up half the screen and the two
    blocks will show next to each other.
  %col
    This block will adjust to the first one automatically.
  ```
